This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over an array. The `Bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `BugSolution.java` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from using `i <= array.length` in the loop condition; it should be `i < array.length` to avoid exceeding the array bounds. This example highlights the importance of careful array index management to prevent runtime exceptions.
